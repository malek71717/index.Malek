        <p>
           <mark>Cybersecurity threats</mark> are among the most serious challenges facing the digital world today, and they continue to grow in both number and complexity. These threats include a wide range of attacks, most notably viruses that spread between devices and disrupt systems, and ransomware that encrypts files and demands payment from the victim in exchange for decryption. One of the most common forms of attack is phishing, a deceptive technique used to obtain sensitive information like passwords or bank details through fake emails or websites.

Another significant threat is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which flood a website or system with excessive traffic to crash or disable it. Social engineering is also a dangerous tactic, where attackers manipulate human behavior to gain access to information or systems without needing technical hacking.

These threats affect everyone—from individuals to large corporations and even governments. A simple breach can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, disruption of critical systems, or major financial losses. As a result, it has become essential to adopt advanced protection strategies such as intrusion detection systems, security software, regular updates, and—most importantly—raising user awareness about cybersecurity risks and how to respond when a threat occurs.

        <h3 id="The most famous cyber attacks in history">The most famous cyber attacks in history</h3>
        <p>1.  <mark>WannaCry Attack</mark> (2017)<br>
            This was a ransomware attack that spread rapidly across the globe. It affected over 200,000 devices in about 150 countries, including hospitals in the UK (NHS) and major companies. The attack exploited a vulnerability in Windows systems, encrypting files and demanding a ransom in Bitcoin from victims.<br><br>
                2.	<mark>Stuxnet Attack</mark> (Discovered in 2010)<br>
            Considered one of the most sophisticated and dangerous cyber attacks, believed to have been carried out by nation-states. It targeted Iran’s nuclear program by infecting industrial control systems (SCADA) and physically damaging centrifuges. Stuxnet was the first known virus to cause real-world physical damage, not just data breaches.<br><br>
                3.	<mark>Yahoo Data Breach</mark> (2013–2014)<br>
            One of the largest data breaches in history in terms of the number of affected users. Over 3 billion accounts were compromised, including usernames, passwords, and other personal information. The breach had a huge impact on Yahoo’s reputation, especially during its acquisition by Verizon.</p>

            <h3 id="Cybersecurity laws and regulations">Cybersecurity laws and regulations</h3>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity regulations create a safer digital environment by clearly defining legal responsibilities for individuals and organizations in the event of breaches or data leaks. They also require institutions to follow specific security standards such as encryption, password management, regular system updates, and early reporting of cyberattacks.<br><br>

<mark>Some of the most well-known global laws include:</mark><br><br>
	•	The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, which governs how user data is collected, used, and protected.<br><br>
	•	China’s Cybersecurity Law, which imposes strict control over data and digital infrastructure.<br><br>
	•	Cybercrime laws in many Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt, which address offenses like cyber espionage, blackmail, and hacking.<br><br>

In the Arab world, countries have begun developing clear legislation to fight cybercrimes and enhance data protection. For example, Jordan’s Cybercrime Law regulates the use of technology and outlines penalties for crimes such as defamation and online fraud.<br><br>

These laws play a vital role in building trust in digital transactions and encouraging businesses to invest in technology securely. As cyber threats continue to evolve, it is essential for laws to stay up-to-date and flexible enough to address new developments in the digital world.
