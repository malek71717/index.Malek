                        What is Cybersecurity ?
                </h3>
                <p>
                        <mark>Cybersecurity</mark> is the protection of electronic systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. It aims to ensure the
                        confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information using tools like encryption, firewalls, and security
                        software. It also involves user training, strong passwords, and multi-factor authentication. Professionals monitor
                        systems and respond to threats, while ethical hackers help find vulnerabilities. Awareness, policies, and laws play a
                        key role, and with the growth of technology, cybersecurity has become essential for protecting individuals and
                        organizations.

                        Misconceptions about cybersecurity
                </h3>
                <p>
                       <mark> The field of cybersecurity suffers from common misconceptions</mark>, such as it being only for programmers or hackers, or that
                        it’s only important for large companies. In reality, cybersecurity is essential for everyone and requires more than just
                        antivirus software, including awareness and training. The field offers various career paths that don’t always require
                        programming skills. It’s important to correct these misunderstandings and raise awareness about the importance and
                        growing opportunities in cybersecurity.
